# EXT80A - External Expansion Card Adapter for the MZ-80A
This project outlines the design of an adapter which allows the Sharp MZ-80A to be used with a single expansion card. 

Normally an MZ-80A would require the MZ-80AEU expansion unit to add expansion cards but these units are not freely available.

The adapter can be seen here: https://twitter.com/engineerswork1/status/1641513915925291013

Either submit the latest release zip package in releases/ directory to a PCB fabrication plant or contact me as I may have spare.

My website, https://eaw.app will have full build instructions in due course.
